  Smart refrigerators have never been an affordable nor an integrable part of a working familyâ€™s life. Specifically, people with two or more people who are working and altogether make an income of around $30000-$65000 a year. This is the target because this group of people usually cannot afford such things and it is in our best interest to make it available and a viable option for them. The technology that smart refrigerators have so far are an Internet refrigerator--this type of refrigerator uses Internet wifi-connected devices that keep track of the food in the fridge and uses RFID scanning/barcode scanning as a food storer to monitor the food entering and exiting the fridge. This is used to determine whether or not a food item can last or if it needs to be thrown away. The refrigerator, however, wasn't successful because it was too expensive. This does not satisfy the target group and is considered a luxury. It also didn't solve too many food issues that also needed to be addressed. 
  The Internet Digital DIOS was a product made by LG Electronics in June 2000 that used a TV screen and a Local Area Network (LAN) port to monitor the food input and output of the fridge. The refrigerator was designed to control the temperature of the food and offer nutrition information (calories, fat calories, etc.) as well as recipes that uses most, if not all, of the ingredients in the fridge. A webcam was also installed in the fridge that acted as a scanner to track the food in the refrigerator. Another function that the fridge has is that it makes ice from inputting water. This fridge also uses less energy which is a plus. However, this fridge fails because it is not practical for people to buy and it's not necessary for survival. Had it been cheaper, there probably would be a better ratio yield of people buying the product.
