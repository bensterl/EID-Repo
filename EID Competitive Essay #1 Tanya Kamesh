Smart Refrigerator

The customer segment that our group is focusing on is the middle class families with two or more working members and at least one dependent. The median salary of this family lies between $35,000 – 70,000. These families have a salary that is enough for them to live comfortably, but they also need to be very careful with their budget and finances. As this family has 2 working members, they are pressed for time so that they can fulfil their responsibilities in the household without 
compromising on their work-life. 

The smart refrigerator is a device that fulfils an urgent need for the families in this demographic. This fridge will connect to your smart phone via WiFi, and using an app on the phone, it will provide you with an inventory of all the items in your fridge. The fridge will then send you notifications on your phone when you run out of a particular item, say milk, and will then proceed to send you repeated reminders to buy more milk. In addition, this smart fridge will also provide you a list of simple recipes that you can cook with just the ingredients that are available to you at home.

The smart refrigerators that already exist in the market are quite expensive and at the same time do not offer a full range of functionality. They are marketed as more of a novelty, with more apps and extensions associated with it that serve no purpose beyond entertainment than those that provide actual functionality. Due to this, middle class families often do not feel like it is a justifiable expenditure and the product is bought mostly amongst the upper - middle class and the upper class demographic.

This is a product that solves a common problem in a lot of households and can help save busy working people a lot of time. In the context of the internet of things or a smart household, it is yet another way to help optimize people’s daily routines.
